# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
This project is a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the famous Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle. The model is trained on various passenger features such as age, gender, class, and fare to determine the likelihood of survival.


# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢  

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using data from the famous **Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** competition.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and more.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is provided by Kaggle:  
- **train.csv** - Training data with labeled survival outcomes  
- **test.csv** - Test data without survival labels (used for predictions)  

You can find the dataset here: [Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
